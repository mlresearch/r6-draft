abstract: This paper presents a natural extension of stagewise ranking to the the
  case of infinitely many items. We introduce the infinite generalized Mallows model
  (IGM), describe its properties and give procedures to estimate it from data. For
  estimation of multimodal distributions we introduce the Exponential-Blurring-Mean-Shift
  nonparametric clustering algorithm. The experiments highlight the properties of
  the new model and demonstrate that infinite models can be simple, elegant and practical.
