abstract: Graphical models trained using maximum likelihood are a common tool for
  probabilistic inference of marginal distributions. However, this approach suffers
  difficulties when either the inference process or the model is approximate. In this
  paper, the inference process is first defined to be the minimization of a convex
  function, inspired by free energy approximations. Learning is then done directly
  in terms of the performance of the inference process at univariate marginal prediction.
  The main novelty is that this is a direct minimization of empirical risk, where
  the risk measures the accuracy of predicted marginals.
