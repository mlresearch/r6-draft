abstract: A graphical multiagent model (GMM) represents a joint distribution over
  the behavior of a set of agents. One source of knowledge about agentsâ€™ behavior
  may come from game-theoretic analysis, as captured by several graphical game representations
  developed in recent years. GMMs generalize this approach to express arbitrary distributions,
  based on game descriptions or other sources of knowledge bearing on beliefs about
  agent behavior. To illustrate the flexibility of GMMs, we exhibit game-derived models
  that allow probabilistic deviation from equilibrium, as well as models based on
  heuristic action choice. We investigate three different methods of integrating these
  models into a single model representing the combined knowledge sources. To evaluate
  the predictive performance of the combined model, we treat as actual outcome the
  behavior produced by a reinforcement learning process. We find that combining the
  two knowledge sources, using any of the methods, provides better predictions than
  either source alone. Among the combination methods, mixing data outperforms the
  opinion pool and direct update methods investigated in this empirical trial.
