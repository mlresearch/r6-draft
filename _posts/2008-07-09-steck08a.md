abstract: 'In the Bayesian approach to structure learning of graphical models, the
  equivalent sample size (ESS) in the Dirichlet prior over the model parameters was
  recently shown to have an important effect on the maximum-a-posteriori estimate
  of the Bayesian network structure. In our first contribution, we theoretically analyze
  the case of large ESS-values, which complements previous work: among other results,
  we find that the presence of an edge in a Bayesian network is favoured over its
  absence even if both the Dirichlet prior and the data imply independence, as long
  as the conditional empirical distribution is notably different from uniform. In
  our second contribution, we focus on realistic ESS-values, and provide an analytical
  approximation to the ’optimal’ ESS-value in a predictive sense (its accuracy is
  also validated experimentally): this approximation provides an understanding as
  to which properties of the data have the main effect determining the ’optimal’ ESS-value.'
