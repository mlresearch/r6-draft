abstract: The paper introduces a generalization for known probabilistic models such
  as log-linear and graphical models, called here multiplicative models. These models,
  that express probabilities via product of parameters are shown to capture multiple
  forms of contextual independence between variables, including decision graphs and
  noisy-OR functions. An inference algorithm for multiplicative models is provided
  and its correctness is proved. The complexity analysis of the inference algorithm
  uses a more refined parameter than the tree-width of the underlying graph, and shows
  the computational cost does not exceed that of the variable elimination algorithm
  in graphical models. The paper ends with examples where using the new models and
  algorithm is computationally beneficial.
