abstract: Identifying co-varying causal elements in very high dimensional feature
  space with internal structures, e.g., a space with as many as millions of linearly
  ordered features, as one typically encounters in problems such as whole genome association
  (WGA) mapping, remains an open problem in statistical learning. We propose a block-regularized
  regression model for sparse variable selection in a high-dimensional space where
  the covariates are linearly ordered, and are possibly subject to local statistical
  linkages (e.g., block structures) due to spacial or temporal proximity of the features.
  Our goal is to identify a small subset of relevant covariates that are not merely
  from random positions in the ordering, but grouped as contiguous blocks from large
  number of ordered covariates. Following a typical linear regression framework between
  the features and the response, our proposed model employs a sparsity-enforcing Laplacian
  prior for the regression coefficients, augmented by a 1st-order Markovian process
  along the feature sequence that "activates" the regression coefficients in a coupled
  fashion. We describe a sampling-based learning algorithm and demonstrate the performance
  of our method on simulated and biological data for marker identification under WGA.
