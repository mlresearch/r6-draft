abstract: We consider the problem of efficiently learning optimal control policies
  and value functions over large state spaces in an online setting in which estimates
  must be available after each interaction with the world. This paper develops an
  explicitly model-based approach extending the Dyna architecture to linear function
  approximation. Dyna-style planning proceeds by generating imaginary experience from
  the world model and then applying model-free reinforcement learning algorithms to
  the imagined state transitions. Our main results are to prove that linear Dyna-style
  planning converges to a unique solution independent of the generating distribution,
  under natural conditions. In the policy evaluation setting, we prove that the limit
  point is the least-squares (LSTD) solution. An implication of our results is that
  prioritized-sweeping can be soundly extended to the linear approximation case, backing
  up to preceding features rather than to preceding states. We introduce two versions
  of prioritized sweeping with linear Dyna and briefly illustrate their performance
  empirically on the Mountain Car and Boyan Chain problems.
