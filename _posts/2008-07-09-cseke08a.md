abstract: 'We address the problem of computing approximate marginals in Gaussian probabilistic
  models by using mean field and fractional Bethe approximations. As an extension
  of Welling and Teh (2001), we define the Gaussian fractional Bethe free energy in
  terms of the moment parameters of the approximate marginals and derive an upper
  and lower bound for it. We give necessary conditions for the Gaussian fractional
  Bethe free energies to be bounded from below. It turns out that the bounding condition
  is the same as the pairwise normalizability condition derived by Malioutov et al.
  (2006) as a sufficient condition for the convergence of the message passing algorithm.
  By giving a counterexample, we disprove the conjecture in Welling and Teh (2001):
  even when the Bethe free energy is not bounded from below, it can possess a local
  minimum to which the minimization algorithms can converge.'
