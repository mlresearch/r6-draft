abstract: In this paper, we consider planning in stochastic shortest path (SSP) problems,
  a subclass of Markov Decision Problems (MDP). We focus on medium-size problems whose
  state space can be fully enumerated. This problem has numerous important applications,
  such as navigation and planning under uncertainty. We propose a new approach for
  constructing a multi-level hierarchy of progressively simpler abstractions of the
  original problem. Once computed, the hierarchy can be used to speed up planning
  by first finding a policy for the most abstract level and then recursively refining
  it into a solution to the original problem. This approach is fully automated and
  delivers a speed-up of two orders of magnitude over a state-of-the-art MDP solver
  on sample problems while returning near-optimal solutions. We also prove theoretical
  bounds on the loss of solution optimality resulting from the use of abstractions.
