abstract: We conjecture that the worst case number of experiments necessary and sufficient
  to discover a causal graph uniquely given its observational Markov equivalence class
  can be specified as a function of the largest clique in the Markov equivalence class.
  We provide an algorithm that computes intervention sets that we believe are optimal
  for the above task. The algorithm builds on insights gained from the worst case
  analysis in Eberhardt et al. (2005) for sequences of experiments when all possible
  directed acyclic graphs over N variables are considered. A simulation suggests that
  our conjecture is correct. We also show that a generalization of our conjecture
  to other classes of possible graph hypotheses cannot be given easily, and in what
  sense the algorithm is then no longer optimal.
