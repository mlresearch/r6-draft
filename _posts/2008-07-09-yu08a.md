abstract: In this paper we introduce Refractor Importance Sampling (RIS), an improvement
  to reduce error variance in Bayesian network importance sampling propagation under
  evidential reasoning. We prove the existence of a collection of importance functions
  that are close to the optimal importance function under evidential reasoning. Based
  on this theoretic result we derive the RIS algorithm. RIS approaches the optimal
  importance function by applying localized arc changes to minimize the divergence
  between the evidence-adjusted importance function and the optimal importance function.
  The validity and performance of RIS is empirically tested with a large set of synthetic
  Bayesian networks and two real-world networks.
