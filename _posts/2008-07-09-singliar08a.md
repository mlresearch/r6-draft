abstract: 'Numerous temporal inference tasks such as fault monitoring and anomaly
  detection exhibit a persistence property: for example, if something breaks, it stays
  broken until an intervention. When modeled as a Dynamic Bayesian Network, persistence
  adds dependencies between adjacent time slices, often making exact inference over
  time intractable using standard inference algorithms. However, we show that persistence
  implies a regular structure that can be exploited for efficient inference. We present
  three successively more general classes of models: persistent causal chains (PCCs),
  persistent causal trees (PCTs) and persistent polytrees (PPTs), and the corresponding
  exact inference algorithms that exploit persistence. We show that analytic asymptotic
  bounds for our algorithms compare favorably to junction tree inference; and we demonstrate
  empirically that we can perform exact smoothing on the order of 100 times faster
  than the approximate Boyen-Koller method on randomly generated instances of persistent
  tree models. We also show how to handle non-persistent variables and how persistence
  can be exploited effectively for approximate filtering.'
