abstract: The paper introduces AND/OR importance sampling for probabilistic graphical
  models. In contrast to importance sampling, AND/OR importance sampling caches samples
  in the AND/OR space and then extracts a new sample mean from the stored samples.
  We prove that AND/OR importance sampling may have lower variance than importance
  sampling; thereby providing a theoretical justification for preferring it over importance
  sampling. Our empirical evaluation demonstrates that AND/OR importance sampling
  is far more accurate than importance sampling in many cases.
