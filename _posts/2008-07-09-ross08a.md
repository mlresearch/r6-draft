title: 'Model-based Bayesian reinforcement learning in large structured domains'
abstract: 'Model-based Bayesian reinforcement learning has generated significant interest in the AI community as it provides an elegant solution to the optimal exploration-exploitation tradeoff in classical reinforcement learning. Unfortunately, the applicability of this type of approach has been limited to small domains due to the high complexity of reasoning about the joint posterior over model parameters. In this paper, we consider the use of factored representations combined with online planning techniques, to improve scalability of these methods. The main contribution of this paper is a Bayesian framework for learning the structure and parameters of a dynamical system, while also simultaneously planning a (near-)optimal sequence of actions.'
