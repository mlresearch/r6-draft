abstract: Exemplar-based clustering methods have been shown to produce state-of-the-art
  results on a number of synthetic and real-world clustering problems. They are appealing
  because they offer computational benefits over latent-mean models and can handle
  arbitrary pairwise similarity measures between data points. However, when trying
  to recover underlying structure in clustering problems, tailored similarity measures
  are often not enough; we also desire control over the distribution of cluster sizes.
  Priors such as Dirichlet process priors allow the number of clusters to be unspecified
  while expressing priors over data partitions. To our knowledge, they have not been
  applied to exemplar-based models. We show how to incorporate priors, including Dirichlet
  process priors, into the recently introduced affinity propagation algorithm. We
  develop an efficient max-product belief propagation algorithm for our new model
  and demonstrate experimentally how the expanded range of clustering priors allows
  us to better recover true clusterings in situations where we have some information
  about the generating process.
