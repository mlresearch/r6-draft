abstract: Deciding what to sense is a crucial task, made harder by dependencies and
  by a non-additive utility function. We develop approximation algorithms for selecting
  an optimal set of measurements, under a dependency structure modeled by a tree-shaped
  Bayesian network (BN).Our approach is a generalization of composing anytime algorithm
  represented by conditional performance profiles. This is done by relaxing the input
  monotonicity assumption, and extending the local compilation technique to more general
  classes of performance profiles (PPs). We apply the extended scheme to selecting
  a subset of measurements for choosing a maximum expectation variable in a binary
  valued BN, and for minimizing the worst variance in a Gaussian BN.
