abstract: We consider how an agent should update her uncertainty when it is represented
  by a set P of probability distributions and the agent observes that a random variable
  X takes on value x, given that the agent makes decisions using the minimax criterion,
  perhaps the best-studied and most commonly-used criterion in the literature. We
  adopt a game-theoretic framework, where the agent plays against a bookie, who chooses
  some distribution from P. We consider two reasonable games that differ in what the
  bookie knows when he makes his choice. Anomalies that have been observed before,
  like time inconsistency, can be understood as arising because different games are
  being played, against bookies with different information. We characterize the important
  special cases in which the optimal decision rules according to the minimax criterion
  amount to either conditioning or simply ignoring the information. Finally, we consider
  the relationship between conditioning and calibration when uncertainty is described
  by sets of probabilities.
