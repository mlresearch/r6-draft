abstract: A central task in many applications is reasoning about processes that change
  over continuous time. Continuous-Time Bayesian Networks is a general compact representation
  language for multi-component continuous-time processes. However, exact inference
  in such processes is exponential in the number of components, and thus infeasible
  for most models of interest. Here we develop a novel Gibbs sampling procedure for
  multi-component processes. This procedure iteratively samples a trajectory for one
  of the components given the remaining ones. We show how to perform exact sampling
  that adapts to the natural time scale of the sampled process. Moreover, we show
  that this sampling procedure naturally exploits the structure of the network to
  reduce the computational cost of each step. This procedure is the first that can
  provide asymptotically unbiased approximation in such processes.
