abstract: We present and evaluate new techniques for designing algorithm portfolios.
  In our view, the problem has both a scheduling aspect and a machine learning aspect.
  Prior work has largely addressed one of the two aspects in isolation. Building on
  recent work on the scheduling aspect of the problem, we present a technique that
  addresses both aspects simultaneously and has attractive theoretical guarantees.
  Experimentally, we show that this technique can be used to improve the performance
  of state-of-the-art algorithms for Boolean satisfiability, zero-one integer programming,
  and A.I. planning.
