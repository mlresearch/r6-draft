title: 'New techniques for algorithm portfolio design'
abstract: 'We present and evaluate new techniques for designing algorithm portfolios. In our view, the problem has both a scheduling aspect and a machine learning aspect. Prior work has largely addressed one of the two aspects in isolation. Building on recent work on the scheduling aspect of the problem, we present a technique that addresses both aspects simultaneously and has attractive theoretical guarantees. Experimentally, we show that this technique can be used to improve the performance of state-of-the-art algorithms for Boolean satisfiability, zero-one integer programming, and A.I. planning.'
