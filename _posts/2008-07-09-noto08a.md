abstract: We consider the task of learning mappings from sequential data to real-valued
  responses. We present and evaluate an approach to learning a type of hidden Markov
  model (HMM) for regression. The learning process involves inferring the structure
  and parameters of a conventional HMM, while simultaneously learning a regression
  model that maps features that characterize paths through the model to continuous
  responses. Our results, in both synthetic and biological domains, demonstrate the
  value of jointly learning the two components of our approach.
