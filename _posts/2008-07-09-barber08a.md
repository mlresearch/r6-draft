abstract: We introduce Clique Matrices as an alternative representation of undirected
  graphs, being a generalisation of the incidence matrix representation. Here we use
  clique matrices to decompose a graph into a set of possibly overlapping clusters,
  defined as well-connected subsets of vertices. The decomposition is based on a statistical
  description which encourages clusters to be well connected and few in number. Inference
  is carried out using a variational approximation. Clique matrices also play a natural
  role in parameterising positive definite matrices under zero constraints on elements
  of the matrix. We show that clique matrices can parameterise all positive definite
  matrices restricted according to a decomposable graph and form a structured Factor
  Analysis approximation in the non-decomposable case.
