abstract: In many machine learning problems, labeled training data is limited but
  unlabeled data is ample. Some of these problems have instances that can be factored
  into multiple views, each of which is nearly sufficent in determining the correct
  labels. In this paper we present a new algorithm for probabilistic multi-view learning
  which uses the idea of stochastic agreement between views as regularization. Our
  algorithm works on structured and unstructured problems and easily generalizes to
  partial agreement scenarios. For the full agreement case, our algorithm minimizes
  the Bhattacharyya distance between the models of each view, and performs better
  than CoBoosting and two-view Perceptron on several flat and structured classification
  problems.
