abstract: 'Much recent work has concerned sparse approximations to speed up the Gaussian
  process regression from the unfavorable O(n3) scaling in computational time to O(nm2).
  Thus far, work has concentrated on models with one covariance function. However,
  in many practical situations additive models with multiple covariance functions
  may perform better, since the data may contain both long and short length-scale
  phenomena. The long length-scales can be captured with global sparse approximations,
  such as fully independent conditional (FIC), and the short length-scales can be
  modeled naturally by covariance functions with compact support (CS). CS covariance
  functions lead to naturally sparse covariance matrices, which are computationally
  cheaper to handle than full covariance matrices. In this paper, we propose a new
  sparse Gaussian process model with two additive components: FIC for the long length-scales
  and CS covariance function for the short length-scales. We give theoretical and
  experimental results and show that under certain conditions the proposed model has
  the same computational complexity as FIC. We also compare the model performance
  of the proposed model to additive models approximated by fully and partially independent
  conditional (PIC). We use real data sets and show that our model outperforms FIC
  and PIC approximations for data sets with two additive phenomena.'
