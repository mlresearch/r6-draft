abstract: We study a multiagent learning problem where agents can either learn via
  repeated interactions, or can follow the advice of a mediator who suggests possible
  actions to take. We present an algorithm that each agent can use so that, with high
  probability, they can verify whether or not the mediator’s advice is useful. In
  particular, if the mediator’s advice is useful then agents will reach a correlated
  equilibrium, but if the mediator’s advice is not useful, then agents are not harmed
  by using our test, and can fall back to their original learning algorithm. We then
  generalize our algorithm and show that in the limit it always correctly verifies
  the mediator’s advice.
