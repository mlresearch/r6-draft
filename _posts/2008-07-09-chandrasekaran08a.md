abstract: It is well-known that inference in graphical models is hard in the worst
  case, but tractable for models with bounded treewidth. We ask whether treewidth
  is the only structural criterion of the underlying graph that enables tractable
  inference. In other words, is there some class of structures with unbounded treewidth
  in which inference is tractable? Subject to a combinatorial hypothesis due to Robertson
  et al. (1994), we show that low treewidth is indeed the only structural restriction
  that can ensure tractability. Thus, even for the "best case" graph structure, there
  is no inference algorithm with complexity polynomial in the treewidth.
