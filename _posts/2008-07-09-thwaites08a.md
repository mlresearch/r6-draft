abstract: A Chain Event Graph (CEG) is a graphical model which is designed to embody
  conditional independencies in problems whose state spaces are highly asymmetric
  and do not admit a natural product structure. In this paper we present a probability
  propagation algorithm which uses the topology of the CEG to build a transporter
  CEG. Intriguingly, the transporter CEG is directly analogous to the triangulated
  Bayesian Network (BN) in the more conventional junction tree propagation algorithms
  used with BNs. The propagation method uses factorization formulae also analogous
  to (but different from) the ones using potentials on cliques and separators of the
  BN. It appears that the methods will be typically more efficient than the BN algorithms
  when applied to contexts where there is significant asymmetry present.
