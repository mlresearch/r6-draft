abstract: We consider conditions that allow us to find an optimal strategy for sequential
  decisions from a given data situation. For the case where all interventions are
  unconditional (atomic), identifiability has been discussed by Pearl &amp; Robins
  (1995). We argue here that an optimal strategy must be conditional, i.e. take the
  information available at each decision point into account. We show that the identification
  of an optimal sequential decision strategy is more restrictive, in the sense that
  conditional interventions might not always be identified when atomic interventions
  are. We further demonstrate that a simple graphical criterion for the identifiability
  of an optimal strategy can be given.
