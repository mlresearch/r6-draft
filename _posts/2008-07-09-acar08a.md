abstract: Many algorithms and applications involve repeatedly solving variations of
  the same inference problem; for example we may want to introduce new evidence to
  the model or perform updates to conditional dependencies. The goal of adaptive inference
  is to take advantage of what is preserved in the model and perform inference more
  rapidly than from scratch. In this paper, we describe techniques for adaptive inference
  on general graphs that support marginal computation and updates to the conditional
  probabilities and dependencies in logarithmic time. We give experimental results
  for an implementation of our algorithm, and demonstrate its potential performance
  benefit in the study of protein structure.
