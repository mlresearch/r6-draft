abstract: 'In this work we present Cutting Plane Inference (CPI), a Maximum A Posteriori
  (MAP) inference method for Statistical Relational Learning. Framed in terms of Markov
  Logic and inspired by the Cutting Plane Method, it can be seen as a meta algorithm
  that instantiates small parts of a large and complex Markov Network and then solves
  these using a conventional MAP method. We evaluate CPI on two tasks, Semantic Role
  Labelling and Joint Entity Resolution, while plugging in two different MAP inference
  methods: the current method of choice for MAP inference in Markov Logic, MaxWalkSAT,
  and Integer Linear Programming. We observe that when used with CPI both methods
  are significantly faster than when used alone. In addition, CPI improves the accuracy
  of MaxWalkSAT and maintains the exactness of Integer Linear Programming.'
