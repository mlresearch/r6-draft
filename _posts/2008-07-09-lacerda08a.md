abstract: We generalize Shimizu et al’s (2006) ICA-based approach for discovering
  linear non-Gaussian acyclic (LiNGAM) Structural Equation Models (SEMs) from causally
  sufficient, continuous-valued observational data. By relaxing the assumption that
  the generating SEM’s graph is acyclic, we solve the more general problem of linear
  non-Gaussian (LiNG) SEM discovery. LiNG discovery algorithms output the distribution
  equivalence class of SEMs which, in the large sample limit, represents the population
  distribution. We apply a LiNG discovery algorithm to simulated data. Finally, we
  give sufficient conditions under which only one of the SEMs in the output class
  is "stable".
