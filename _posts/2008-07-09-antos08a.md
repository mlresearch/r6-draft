abstract: We present an algorithm that identifies the reasoning patterns of agents
  in a game, by iteratively examining the graph structure of its Multi-Agent Influence
  Diagram (MAID) representation. If the decision of an agent participates in no reasoning
  patterns, then we can effectively ignore that decision for the purpose of calculating
  a Nash equilibrium for the game. In some cases, this can lead to exponential time
  savings in the process of equilibrium calculation. Moreover, our algorithm can be
  used to enumerate the reasoning patterns in a game, which can be useful for constructing
  more effective computerized agents interacting with humans.
