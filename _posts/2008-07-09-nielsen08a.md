abstract: Bayesian networks can be used to extract explanations about the observed
  state of a subset of variables. In this paper, we explicate the desiderata of an
  explanation and confront them with the concept of explanation proposed by existing
  methods. The necessity of taking into account causal approaches when sal graph is
  available is discussed. We then introduce causal explanation trees, based on the
  construction of explanation trees using the measure of causal information flow (Ay
  and Polani, 2006). This approach is compared to several other methods on known networks.
