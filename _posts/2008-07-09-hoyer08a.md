abstract: An important task in data analysis is the discovery of causal relationships
  between observed variables. For continuous-valued data, linear acyclic causal models
  are commonly used to model the data-generating process, and the inference of such
  models is a well-studied problem. However, existing methods have significant limitations.
  Methods based on conditional independencies (Spirtes et al. 1993; Pearl 2000) cannot
  distinguish between independence-equivalent models, whereas approaches purely based
  on Independent Component Analysis (Shimizu et al. 2006) are inapplicable to data
  which is partially Gaussian. In this paper, we generalize and combine the two approaches,
  to yield a method able to learn the model structure in many cases for which the
  previous methods provide answers that are either incorrect or are not as informative
  as possible. We give exact graphical conditions for when two distinct models represent
  the same family of distributions, and empirically demonstrate the power of our method
  through thorough simulations.
