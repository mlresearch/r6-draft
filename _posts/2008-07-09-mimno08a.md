abstract: Although fully generative models have been successfully used to model the
  contents of text documents, they are often awkward to apply to combinations of text
  data and document metadata. In this paper we propose a Dirichlet-multinomial regression
  (DMR) topic model that includes a log-linear prior on document-topic distributions
  that is a function of observed features of the document, such as author, publication
  venue, references, and dates. We show that by selecting appropriate features, DMR
  topic models can meet or exceed the performance of several previously published
  topic models designed for specific data.
